### SHUFFLE-TEST-010: Reset Button Functionality

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that the reset button clears the game state and move counter
- **Expected**: Clicking reset sets moves to 0 and restores initial coin positions

### SHUFFLE-TEST-011: Focus and Locked Border Colors

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that the focus border is yellow and the locked border is violet
- **Expected**: Focused slot has yellow stroke; locked slot has violet stroke
- **Test File**: `test/integration/shuffle-ui.test.tsx`

### SHUFFLE-TEST-012: Touch Drag Sensitivity

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that the drag threshold is reduced for earlier movement initialization
- **Expected**: Coin moves to adjacent slot with a smaller drag distance (e.g., 25 units instead of 50+ units)
- **Test File**: `test/integration/touch-drag.test.tsx`

### SHUFFLE-TEST-013: Board UI Cleanup

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that faint slot lines are removed and board border is a single path
- **Expected**: No rects with #333 stroke; board outline is a single path element

### SHUFFLE-TEST-015: Rotated Input Mapping

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that touch and keyboard inputs are correctly remapped on mobile
- **Expected**: Screen Down moves coin Board Right; Screen Right moves coin Board Up, etc.

### SHUFFLE-TEST-016: Tuned Touch Sensitivity

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that drag threshold is relaxed to allow easier movement
- **Expected**: Dragging 16 units (out of 100) triggers a move

- **Test File**: N/A (Visual/Code Verification)

### SHUFFLE-TEST-018: Mobile Drag Direction

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Verify that dragging Screen Down on mobile triggers a move to the slot visually below
- **Expected**: Drag offset {x:0, y:25} triggers move from L2 to C1 (which is visually below L2 in mobile layout)

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit Tests: 80%+ coverage for critical functionality
- Integration Tests: Key workflow paths
- End-to-end Tests: User scenarios

## Notes

All test cases must be documented here before test implementation begins, following the TDD approach of the 7-step workflow.
