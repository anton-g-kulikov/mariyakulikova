### Changed

- **Coins Shuffler Refinements**:

  - Enhanced visual feedback: Focus border changed to yellow, locked border changed to violet.
  - Increased touch sensitivity: Coins now trigger movement significantly earlier in the drag process.
  - Added dedicated Reset Button for easier game restarts.
  - Cleaned up Board UI: Removed faint slot grid lines and unified the board border into a single solid path.
  - Added Mobile Rotation: The game field now automatically rotates 90 degrees on devices with width < 480px for better portrait orientation fit.
  - Synchronized Rotated Controls: Touch dragging and keyboard navigation are now perfectly remapped to match the visual 90-degree rotation on mobile.
  - **Russian Localization**: Translated the entire game interface, rules, and controls into Russian.
  - **Child-Friendly Redesign**: Updated the visual theme with a colorful palette (lavender/pink), playful fonts, and bright 3D-style buttons.
  - **Multi-Level System**: Introduced a progression system with 3 levels:
    - Уровень 1: Разминка (3 слота, 2 монеты)
    - Уровень 2: Посложнее (5 слотов, 4 монеты)
    - Уровень 3: Классика (10 слотов, 6 монет)
  - **Dynamic Navigation**: Implemented coordinate-based proximity search for keyboard navigation to support arbitrary level layouts.
